# Alexander's Portfolio

Welcome to the Github Page for my portfolio. Feel free to have a look around to see how I write my code.

The site was built using Vite + Vue, 3D elements were done with ThreeJS, and I used Tailwind for styling. It is hosted on a DigitalOcean droplet and the CI is done with Github Actions and Terraform.

Or you can just view the live site [here](https://alexdb.me).

## About Me

My name is Alexander Bhojwani, I'm 29 this year and I'm a full-stack software engineer.

I graduated from Singapore Management University with a BSc of Economics (hons) and I am currently working in a startup called SmilePepper as a junior SWE (among other roles).

I also have a strong background as a creative, with many years of corporate design work under my sleeve.
